# Bug Report(s)

Please check out HEAD to work out the various revisions you need for 
each bug report.

If there is a need for a licence for a bug report, everything is 
released under the GPL v2 or later, and at the discretion of the owner 
of the project to whom I'm submitting a bug, whatever licence they have 
used in their project.
